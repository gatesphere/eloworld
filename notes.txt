eloworld notes
--------------

2 dimensional world on a Cartesian grid
Mobile game-playing agents with various attributes:
  ELO rating (default 1000) <- Perceived skill
  Ranking (A,B,C,D,E,F, based on ELO rating)
  Actual skill
  Whim - modifier chance that they'll accept any encounter

Agents' actual skill, for simplicity, is constant
Agents' ELO rating is calculated on every encounter
Agents may refuse a game
Agents actively seek out players who are higher ranked.

Encounters are simple games, either Zero-Sum or otherwise.
Game does not have to be implemented, only the results.

Modules:
